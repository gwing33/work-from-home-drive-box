# Work From Home Drive Box

This was built for Mark Rober's Monthly class (Jan 2021). It was the final project build.

First time doing any Arduino coding, so it's very rough around the edges. Both in the code and for the electrical.

## Server Dependencies

This project requires a server, and that project is [located over here](https://github.com/gwing33/home-harness)
